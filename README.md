## The Pragmatic Haskeller

A collection of "recipies" (no pun intended) to pragmatically
get things done in Haskell. We'll build a simple web application for managing
recipies. In particular, we'll focus on:

* How to parse Json files describing recipies

* Build a web service which sends us back recipies ad Json file.

* A DSL for describing recipies

* An Async agent for decoupling heavy computations from our REST endpoints
